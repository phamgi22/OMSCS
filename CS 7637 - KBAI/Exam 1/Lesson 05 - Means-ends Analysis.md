# Lesson 5

Not all problems are well-formed but for those that are, another type of analysis which will be useful for us is the means-ends analysis. This lesson will cover the following:

- State spaces
- Means-ends analysis
- Problem solving with means-ends analysis
- Problem reduction

## State Spaces

We can imagine problem solving as occurring in a state space. There is an initial state and a goal state where the goal state consists of all of the states that could be produced from the initial state to fulfill the goal.

## Differences In State Spaces

So how does an AI agent get from the initial state to the goal state? When examining differences in state spaces compared to the goal state, the agent can select an operator (means) which will produce a state that matches the goal state (ends) or gets closer to the goal state. This is what we mean by means-ends analysis, to select an operator to meet the end state.

## Process Of Means-ends Analysis

For each operator that can be applied:

1. Apply the operator to the current state
2. Calculate the difference between new state and goal state

The agent should prefer the state that minimizes the distance between new and goal state.

## Problem Reduction

The concept of problem reduction is to reduce a problem and find the solutions for those sub-problems. Then once those solutions are found, combine them to solve the whole problem.

## Section Quizzes

### The Block Problem Quiz

_Write a list of operators `Move(Object, Location)` that will move the blocks (provided) into the goal state_

- `Move(C, Table)`
- `Move(B, C)`
- `Move(A, B)`

### Block Problem I Quiz

_What are the three possible next states? Write the location of each block_.

- A can move on top of D
- D can move on top of A
- D can move on top of the table

### Block Problem II Quiz

_What is the difference between each state and the goal state_?

- A can move on top of D (difference of 3)
- D can move on top of A (difference of 3)
- D can move on top of the table (difference of 2)

### Block Problem III Quiz

_Using means-ends analysis, which move will be chosen_?

D can move on top of the Table (difference of 2), since this is the shortest path (lowest difference of the three paths).

### Block Problem IV Quiz

_How many possible next states are there? How many of those states reduce the difference to the goal_?

There are seven possible states and only one of them can reduce the difference

### Block Problem V Quiz

_How many possible next states are there? How many of those states reduce the difference to the goal_?

There are three possible states and none of them can reduce the difference.

### Problem Reduction I Quiz

_What are the three possible next states? Write the location of each block_.

- A can move on top of D
- D can move on top of A
- A can move on top of the table

### Problem Reduction II Quiz

_What is the difference between each state and the goal state_?

- A can move on top of D (difference of 1)
- D can move on top of A (difference of 2)
- A can move on top of the table (difference of 1)

### Problem Reduction III Quiz

_Write a list of operators `Move(Object, Location)` that will move the blocks (provided) into the goal state_

- `Move(B, Table)`
- `Move(C, D)`

### Problem Reduction IV Quiz

_Write a list of operators `Move(Object, Location)` that will move the blocks (provided) into the goal state_

- `Move(B, C)`
- `Move(A, B)`

### Final Quiz

_What did you learn in this lesson_?

- Means-ends analysis looks for an operator (means) that reduces the difference between the initial and the goal state (ends)
- When means-ends does not work, use problem reduction which seeks to solve the sub-problems of a bigger problem
- Means-ends and problem reduction are weak methods because they do not rely on knowledge. By relying on knowledge we could create stronger methods to solve more difficult problems. The selection between using strong or weak methods for humans depends on the amount of knowledge or experience available to complete a task
