# Lesson 1

In this lesson we will cover the following topics:

1. Conundrums in and characteristics of AI
2. KBAI (knowledge-based AI) and the four schools of AI
3. Cognitive systems
4. Topics in AI

## Conundrums In AI ?

There are several of conundrums in AI:

1. Intelligent agents have limited resources: processing speed, etc
2. Computation is local, but ai problems have global constraints
3. Logic is deductive, but many problems are not (abductive or inductive)
4. The world is dynamic, but knowledge is limited
5. Problem solving, reasoning, and learning are complex, but explanation and justification are even more complex: ai need explain its decision

## Characteristics Of AI Problems ?

AI problems have many characteristics:

1. Knowledge often arrives incrementally: knowledge does come at the same time
2. Problems exhibit recurring patterns
3. Problems have multiple levels of granularity (abstractions level)
4. Many problems are computationally intractable (no exist algo to solve the problems)
5. The world is dynamic, but knowledge of the world is static
6. The world is open-ended, but knowledge the world is limited

## Characteristics Of AI Agents

Below are some of the characteristics of AI agents:

1. Agents have limited computing power: processing speed, memory size
2. Agents have limited sensors: cannot perceive everything in the world
3. Agents have limited attention: cannot focus everything at the same time
4. Computational logic is fundamentally deductive
5. AI agents' knowledge is incomplete relative to the world

AI agents with bounded cabapility to solve AI problems

## What Is Knowledge ?

Knowledge-based AI is a process that involves **reasoning**, **learning**, and **memory**. These three processes are intimately connected and are known as **deliberation**. The deliberation process is one part of the overall architecture of a KBAI agent.

## What is the fundamental process of Knowledge based AI ?
1. Reasoning
2. Learning
3. Memory
- All are interconntected
- We need to unify reasoning, learning, and reasoning
- All three together is Deliberation

## What is the general Agent architecture ?
- Input: percepts of the world into deliberation
- Deliberation
- Output: from deliberation, actions on the world

## What are the Four Schools Of AI ? 

The four schools of AI can be broken down into:

1. Agents that _think_ like _humans_: semantic web that understand information
2. Agents that _act_ like _humans_: improvisational robots that can dance to music
3. Agents that _think_ _optimally_: machine learning
4. Agents that _act_ _optimally_: airplane autopilot

In this class KBAI, we are interested in agent that **think** like human

## What Are Cognitive Systems ?

Cognitive: dealing with human like intelligence
System: muljtiple interacting components such as learning, reasoning, and memory
Cognitive systems: are systems which exhibit human-like intelligence through processes like learning, reasoning, and memory.

## What is Cognitive System Architecture definitiona and components

The basic diagram of a cognitive system includes receiving some input from the world to the cognitive system and responding with an output. There may be more than one cognitive system available working together to receive input and provide an output.

- cognitive system situation in the physical world
- percepts: information that cognitive system can perceive through sensors
- actuators: something that act on the world, like finger that carry out action in the world
- percepts: input
- action: output that carried out by actuators

## Multiple Cognitive Systems System
- System contains multiple cognitive system
- System: situate in the physical world
- System: also situate in the social world where systems interact with each other

## What type of Cognitive systems that can be inside of a muitple cognitive systems system?
- Reaction system: brake when driving
- Deliberation system: change lane (percepts: look around for information, action: change lane)
- Metacognition system: car behind honk when i am trying to change lane (change, repair the deliberation that led to sub-optimal changing plan actions)
  
## What are topics In KBAI

There are several topics we will cover in KBAI:

1. Fundamentals:
- Semantic networks
- generate and test
- production system
- mean end analysis
- problem reduction
3. Planning
- logic
- planning
4. Common Sense Reasoning
- frame (knowledge representation)
- understanding
- common sense reasoning
- scripts
5. Learning
- learning by recording cases
- incremental concept learning
- classification
- version spaces
6. Analogical Reasoning
- learning by recording cases
- case based reasoning
- explaination based learning
- analogical reasoning
7. Visuospatial reasoning
- constraint propagation
- visuospatial reasoning
8. Design and creativity
- configuration
- diagnosis
- design
- creativity
9. Metacognition
- learning by correcting mistakes
- meta-reasoning
- ethics in artificial intelligence
