# Lesson 7

In this lesson we look into _frames_ the first step to building common sense reasoning. We will also cover the following:

1. Function of frames
2. Properties of frames
3. Relationship between frames and previous topics
4. Frames for advanced sense-making


## What is special about frame?
Frame is the basic unit of Common Sense Reasoning

## How Do We Make Sense Of A Sentence

A **frame** is a knowledge structure where a number of things could be happening in a particular knowledge representation. By breaking down a sentence into a frame, we could make more sense out of a sentence.

## Complex Frame Systems

Complex frame systems can be created by adding frames to an already existing frame, e.g., nouns in a sentence.

## Properties Of Frames

The following are properties of frames:

1. Represent stereotypes: for example what happen if something is eaten, dead
2. Provide default values: default object-alive is filled as false
3. Exhibit inheritance: animal
                     --> ant: 6 legs
                     --> human: 2 legs

## Frames And Semantic Nets

Frames and semantic networks are closely related. We can capture the same details as semantic networks in frames by denoting the same information within a frame representation.

## Frames And Production Systems

Referring back to production systems, we can think of frames as conceptual knowledge stored in the semantic memory. Since a frame tells us what to look for, processing is not just bottom up coming from things such as natural language processing but also partially top down as the mind is able to provide a frame of which knowledge could be structured.


### Frames And Semantic Networks Quiz

_Fill out the frame for the given picture (provided)_
- Creating a frame for each object in the image
| Name   | x        | y      | z      |
| ------ | -------- | ------ | ------ |
| Shape  | triangle | circle | circle |
| Size   | large    | large  | small  |
| Fill   | false    | false  | true   |
| Inside | N/A      | N/A    | y      |
| Above  | N/A      | x      | x      |

## Frames and production system
- frames with production systems: partially top down
- frames are a structured knowledge of representation (molecules)
- frames construct a theory of processing: partially top down
- frames capture stereotypes but stereotypes can lead to incorrect inferences
- frame can capture a large amount of info 
- production systems: atoms of knowledge representation capture small amount of info
