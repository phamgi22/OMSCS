# Lesson 2

In this lesson we will go over class goals, outcomes, and strategies, projects, and assignments. There will also be opportunity to dive into computational psychometrics and Raven's Progressive Matrices. Lastly, we will finish up with principles of CS 7637.

## Class Goals

Goals of this class include learning:
- Core methods of KBAI: schemes for structured knowledge represenation, memory organization, reasoning, learning, cognitive architecture, meta reasoning (reasoning about reasoning)
- Tasks addressed by KBAI: planning, explaination, diagnosis, and design 
- How KBAI agents use these methods to address these tasks
- The relationship between AI and human recognition:
    - Use theories of human cognition to design human like AI
    - Use AI technique about testable hypothese about human cognition 

## Class Learning Outcomes

Class outcomes include:
- Designing and implementing a KBAI agent: related to 1st learning goal 
- Using formal strategies and agents to address complex practical problems: related to 2nd learning goal 
- Using the design and results of KBAI agents to reflect on human cognition and vise versa: related to 4th learning goal

## Class Strategies

We will learn in this class through 
- examples,
- doing
- project-based learning: mini projects
- personalization
- and reflection: end of each lession, journal/report
- extra: collaborative learning

## Introduction To Computational Psychometrics

**Psychometrics** is a study of human intelligence, aptitude, and knowledge. 
**Computational psychometrics** is the design of computer agents that can take the same kinds of tests (intelligence, aptitude, and knowledge) as humans.
- analyze how well ai do compare to human
- understand how human intelligence works through designing ai agent

## Raven's Progressive Matrices

**Raven's Progressive Matrices** were written in the 1930s to examine general intelligence. The test consists of 60 strictly **visual** multiple-choice analogy problems. These matrices range from 2x2, 3x3, to even a special 2x1 matrix. 

## Definition of Intelligence
- We dont have a definition of it, we only study it

## 7 Principles Of Knowledge based AI

There are several principles for KBAI:
1. KBAI agents represent and organize knowledge into knowledge structures to guide and support reasoning
- Agent use knowledge to guide reasoning
- Agent represent and organize knowledge into knowledge structures
2. Learning in KBAI agents is often incremental
3. Reasoning in KBAI agents is top-down as well as bottom-up:
- reasoning is formed through data
- and pull knowledge out of memory, then use this knowledge to generate expectation to make sense to the world
4. KBAI agents match methods to tasks
- AI agent can select specific method for specific task
- AI agent can integrate different methods to address complex tasks
5. KBAI agents use heuristics to find solutions that are **good enough**, though not necessarily optimal
- because there has to be balance trade off between efficiency and optimal solutions
- our focus: use bounded rationality of AI agent and give near real time performance on computationally intractable problem
6. KBAI agents make use of recurring patterns in the problems they solve
- problems have pattern
7. The architecture of KBAI agents enables reasoning, learning, and memory to support and constrain each other
- In KBAI class, we focus on building theories that unify these three components into a cognitive system

## Connection between Raven project and human cognition (The cognitive connection)
1. Psychometric: science of measuring human intelligence
2. Computational psychometrics: science of building AI agent that can take the same Raven test as human
- Computational psychometrics also examine what **error** does AI agent make
- If error is same as human error, this will provide a ground for hypothesis about human thinking on Raven test
- On Raven test of intelligence, autistic people perform equally well compared to neurotypical people. Austistic people perform not as well on other intelligence test
