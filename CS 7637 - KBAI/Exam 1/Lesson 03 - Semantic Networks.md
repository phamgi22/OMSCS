# Lesson 3

In this lesson we will be covering the following topics:

- Knowledge representations
- Semantic networks
- Problem solving with semantic networks
- Represent and reason: represent the knowledge, represent the problem and use the knowledge to address the problem

## Representations

Knowledge of representation has two elements:

1. The language: has a vocabulary
2. The content: knowledge

- E.g., `F = m*a` is an algebraic equation representing Newton's second law.
- There are many types of knowledge of representation, each with its affordances ans constraints
  
## Introduction To Semantic Networks

Steps to constructing a semantic network:

1. Label each element
2. Label the relationship between each element
3. Label the relationship between initial and final state for each element

## Structure Of Semantic Networks

There are several elements for the structure of semantic networks:

1. Lexically: a lexicon (node) contain knowledge about each components 
2. Structurally: directional links
3. Semantically: application-specific labels

## Characteristics Of Good Representations

What are some characteristics of good representations?

- Explicit relationships: circle, triagnle, left, right
- Natural constraints
- Abstraction (at the proper level)
- Precise details (no extraneous details)
- Transparent, concise, complete, fast, and computable (allow to draw inferences)

## Choosing matches by weights

## Connections

The correspondence problem: given two situations, what object in one situation corresponds to what object in another situation?

Recall that the emphasis so far as been on the relationships between objects. For cognition in general, the focus is always on relationships.
