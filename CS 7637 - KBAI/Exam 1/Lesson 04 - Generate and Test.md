# Lesson 4

In this lesson we will be covering the following topics:

- Generate and test method
- Smart generators
- Smart testers
- Generate and test for Raven's Progressive Matrices

## Guards And Prisoners

KBAI is a collection of three things:

1. Knowledge representations
2. Problem solving techniques
3. Architectures

Referring back to the guards and prisoners problem, a typical _dumb_ generator will generate all possible scenarios and a _dumb_ tester will eliminate scenarios based on specific rules.

## Smart Testers

A smart tester will not only remove scenarios based on rules, it will also check for identical states.

## Smart Generators

A smart generator will not generate all possible scenarios, instead it will generate states which are not redundant or illegal.

## Section Quizzes

### Generate And Test II Quiz

_Which states (provided) will the tester dismiss based on the rules of the problem_?

F will be dismissed.

### Final Quiz

_What did you learn in this lesson_?

- Designing a smart generator and tester will make problem solving much easier for an AI agent
- Coupling semantic networks (a knowledge representation) with the generate and test method (a problem solving technique) will enable an AI agent to solve more difficult problems more efficiently such as the intelligence test
- Generate and test method is used all the time to test hypotheses
