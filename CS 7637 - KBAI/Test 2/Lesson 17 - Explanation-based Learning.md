# Lesson 17

In _explanation-based learning_ an agent learns about new connections between existing concepts rather than learning about new concepts. Explanation-based learning could be used to introduce the notion of knowledge transfer from an old situation to a new situation. We will cover the following:

1. Concept space
2. Abstraction
3. Analogical transfer

## Concept Space

An agent might represent concepts with facts about a particular concept in the form of a concept space. What prior knowledge does an agent need to build explanations? An agent might have prior knowledge of various concepts such that a causual connection could be made between them.

## Abstraction

An agent might make use of prior knowledge in a concept space and abstract the causual connections between various concepts to come up with a solution or explanation to a problem.

## Transfer

Knowledge transfer occurs by using abstractions of concepts (obtained from prior knowledge) in the concept space and connecting those abstractions to form a new causual connection to a new concept. In practice, an agent typically starts from the given new concept and looks for ways it could draw in prior knowledge to understand a new concept by connecting top-level abstractions (which are goals for the agent to prove) to those in memory.

## Section Quizzes

### Transporting Soup Quiz

_Which of these might be useful for transporting soup from the kitchen to the table_?

The glass pitcher is most useful in this scenario.

### Explanation-based Learning I Quiz

_Given the prior knowledge (provided), can we prove this object is a mug_?

No since the prior knowledge for a mug does not have causal connections which link to the given mystery object.

### Explanation-based Learning II Quiz

_What knowledge would finish our proof that this object (given) is a mug_?

- Knowledge of a wooden spoon
- Knowledge of an oven mitt

### Final Quiz

_What did you learn in this lesson_?

- We as humans are always dealing with novel situations and we create solutions to those situations by forming connections between existing concepts
- Using existing concepts in new ways is known as _speed up learning_ as it builds connections between existing concepts to learn new concepts
- We can only explain things that are consciously accessible (e.g., we cannot easily explain memory processes)
- Although the process for generating explanations may be similar to arriving to a particular decision it is not the same process used in making a decision
