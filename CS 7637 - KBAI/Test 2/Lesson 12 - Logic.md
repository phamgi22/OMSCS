# Lesson 12

In this lesson we will cover _logic_ which is the basis for additional topics such as planning. We will also cover the following:

1. Formal notation
2. Conjunctions, disjunctions, negations, implications
3. Truth tables
4. Rules of inference
5. Resolution theorem proving

## Why Do We Need Formal Logic

We need formal logic for:

- **Soundness**: only valid conclusions can be proven
- **Completeness**: all valid conclusions can be proven

## Predicates

A **predicate** is a function that maps object arguments to true or false values.

## Conjunctions And Disjunctions

Conjunctions (_and_) are denoted by an up arrow head, disjunctions (_or_) are denoted by a down arrow head. A negation (_not_) will be denoted by the negation symbol as shown in lecture.

## Notation Equivalency

The following notations could be used for formal logic descriptions:

1. `AND`: e.g., `A & B` or `A && B`
2. `OR`: e.g., `A | B` or `A || B`
3. `NOT`: e.g., `!A` or `~A`
4. `IMPLIES`: e.g., `A = B`, `A == B`, `A => B`

## Rules Of Inference

**Rules of inference** suggests to instantiate general rules to prove specific claims. There are two techniques in particular:

1. **Modus Ponens**: `p => q`, `p`, therefore `q`
2. **Modus Tollens**: `p => q` `!q`, therefore `!p`

## Universal Quantifiers

_For all_ qualifiers are also known as **universal qualifiers**. _For at least one_ qualifiers are also known as **existential qualifiers**.

### Inferences About Foos Quiz

_Mark the sufficient conditions that would make this (provided) a foo_.

- A brick supports two blocks
- Those two blocks do not touch
- Those two blocks support a brick

### Practicing Formal Logic Quiz

1. _If an animal lays eggs and does not have feathers, it is a reptile_.
   - `lays-eggs(animal) ∧ ¬feathers(animal) ⇒ reptile(animal)`
2. _If an animal has feathers or has talons, it is a bird_.
   - `feathers(animal) ∨ talons(animal) ⇒ bird(animal)`
3. _If an animal lays eggs, has a beak, and flies, it is a duck_.
   - `lays-eggs(animal) ∧ beak(animal) ∧ flies(animal) ⇒ duck(animal)`
4. _If an animal lays eggs, has a beak, and do not fly, it is a platypus_.
   - `lays-eggs(animal) ∧ beak(animal) ∧ ¬flies(animal) ⇒ platypus(animal)`

### Proof I Quiz

_Write (provided) in formal logic, how do we prove this is a bird_?

`has-wings ∧ ¬has-fur ⇒ bird`

### Proof II Quiz

_Use implication elimination to rewrite as a conditional, how do we prove this is a bird_?

`¬has-wings ∧ ¬has-fur ⋁ bird`

### Proof III Quiz

_Use De Morgan's Law to rewrite in conjunctive normal form, how do we prove this is a bird_?

`¬has-wings ⋁ has-fur ⋁ bird`

### Proof IV Quiz

_What sentence would be assumed to facilitate the proof, how do we prove this is a bird_?

`¬bird`

### Proof V Quiz

_What part of `S1` (provided) would we eliminate first, how do we prove this is a bird_?

We have to eliminate the `bird` first.

### Proof VI Quiz

_What do we do next, how do we prove this is a bird_?

- Resolve on `S2` and `¬has-wings` from `S1`
- Resolve on `S3` and `¬has-fur` from `S1`

### Final Quiz

_What did you learn in this lesson_?

- Logic provides a formal and precise way of reasoning
- Logic also provides a formal notation for expressing how intelligent agents reason
- Logic we have considered so far is deductive, however most of human reasoning is inductive or abductive in its character
- Deduction has to do with reasoning from causes to effects
- Abduction has to do with reasoning from effects to causes
- Induction has to do with generalizing cause and effect relationships from a sample to a population
