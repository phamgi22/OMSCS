# Lesson 20

In this lesson we will talk about _constraint propagation_ which is a general purpose problem solving method. **Constraint propagation** is a mechanism of inference where the agent assigns values to variables to satisfy certain conditions (constraints). We will cover the following:

1. Constraint propagation definition
2. Image processing
3. Natural language understanding
4. Advanced problems

## Constraint Propagation Defined

**Constraint propagation** is a method of inference that assigns values to variables characterizing a problem in such a way that some conditions (constraints) are satisfied.

### Final Quiz

_What did you learn in this lesson_?

- Constraint propagation is a very generalized method like means-ends analysis and it allows us to use our knowledge of the world to make sense of concepts
- Constraint propagation works by assigning values to variables such that a problem satisfies constraints
