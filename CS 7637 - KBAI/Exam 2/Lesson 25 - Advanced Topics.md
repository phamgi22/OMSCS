# Lesson 25

In this lesson we will discuss a handful of very broad topics and advanced applications of KBAI. We will also touch on some of the connections between human cognition and KBAI.

## Visuospatial Reasoning Introduction

**Visuospatial reasoning** is concerned with reasoning about _what_ (visuo) and _where_ (spatial). Visuospatial knowledge is knowledge where causality is, at most, implicit. However, visuospatial knowledge enables inferences about causality.

## Two Views Of Reasoning

- Propositional representations - representations through frames
- Analogical representations - representations through structural correspondence with the external world

Humans appear to use analogical representations for mental imagery. It is not yet known how to implement mental imagery for KBAI.

## Symbol Grounding Problem

_Content_ refers to the content of knowledge while _encoding_ deals with the representation of knowledge. The table below highlights some differences:

|          | Visuospatial                          | Verbal                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Content  | Appearance: what and where            | Arbitrary: driven by inferential needs |
| Encoding | Analogical: structural correspondence | Propositional: no correspondence       |

## Systems Thinking Introduction

The world consists of many different kinds of systems. A system is composed of a heterogenous interacting components. The interaction between components lead to processes of different kinds and these processes can occur at many different levels of abstraction. Consequently, **systems thinking** is reasoning about systems with numerous components and processes at multiple, potentially invisible, levels of abstraction.

Systems thinking allows us to understand the invisible levels of abstraction e.g., bees populations are declining and pesticide use is increasing so the understanding is that the pesticide is toxic to the bees.

## Structure, Behavior, And Function

In AI, we can capture the visible levels of abstraction (structure) and invisible levels of abstraction (e.g., behavior and function) through structure, behavior, and function models. This allows capturing of visible structures and invisible causual processes.

## Design Introduction

**Design thinking** is reasoning able ill-defined, unconstrained, and open-ended problems that are situated in the world. In design thinking, the solution and problem co-evolve over time.

## Creativity Introduction

Some is _creative_ if it is:

1. Novel
2. Valuable
3. Unexpected

Some other processes of creativity may include:

- Emergence
- Re-representation
- Serendipity

## AI Ethics

AI ethics pertain to our economy and society where there are hard issues and ethical implications. Much of the modern development of AI is driven by defence applications across the world. If robots are to become like humans, then what could be said about the civil rights of KBAI robots?

## Section Quizzes

### Defining Creativity Quiz III

_For each of the following tasks (provided), mark the box if successful completion of a task would mean that the agent is creative_.

All of the above.

### Defining Creativity Quiz IV

_Do you agree with Davidâ€™s assessment that none of these results are creative because we can trace through the underlying process that led to them_?

No, because under this definition, humans are only considered creative because we don't know how the brain works yet.

### Final Quiz

_What did you learn in this lesson_?

- Researchers still are unsure how to implement mental imagery for KBAI agents even though it is agreed that humans appear to use analogical representations for mental imagery
- Structure, behavior, and function models allow capturing of visible structures and invisible causual processes
- Creativity is a difficult concept to define but it has to do with novelty, value, and unexpectedness of a solution
- As AI advances, researchers and engineers should discuss ethical implications of AI solutions and ensure that all stakeholders understand risks to society
