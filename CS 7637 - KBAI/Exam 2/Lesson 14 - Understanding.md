# Lesson 14

In this lesson we will examine an intelligent agent's _understanding_ of events and stories in the world which will build on our frame concepts. We cover the following:

1. Thematic role systems
2. Ambiguity
3. Constraints

## Thematic Role Systems

A **thematic role system** is a type of frame representation system where the frame represents an action or event identified by a verb. In these frames, the verb is able to establish expectations about the roles that are connected to that particular event.

Consider the following sentence:

> Ashok made pancakes for David with a griddle

The frame representation could be as follows:

Thematic Role:

- Verb: make
- Agent: Ashok
- Beneficiary: David
- Thematic object: pancakes
- Instrument: griddle

This frame will allow us to draw inferences which will allow an agent to understand the meaning of the sentence.

## Constraints

**Constraints** also allow an agent to understand the meaning of a sentence. Below are some prepositional constraints:

| Preposition | Thematic Roles              |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| by          | agent, conveyance, location |
| for         | beneficiary, duration       |
| from        | source                      |
| to          | destination                 |
| with        | co-agent, instrument        |

## Resolving Ambiguity In Prepositions

However, there may exist ambiguity in sentences such as below where the word _by_ has different thematic roles:

> That was written by Ashok.
> David went to New York by train.
> David stood by the statue.

How to resolve these issues? The agent should have an _ontology_ of the world. That is, it has a conceptualization or model of the world (in lecture it looks like a tree with multiple branches) such that it is able to determine which thematic role _by_ takes in each sentence above.

## Resolving Ambiguity In Verbs

Verbs can also have many different meanings. To resolve ambiguity in verbs, we can create a frame for each meaning of the verb and then eliminate the frames that do not match the verb used in the sentence. This could be done by examining other parts of the sentence and using that knowledge to eliminate ambiguities.

## Section Quizzes

### Thematic Role Systems Quiz

_Consider the following sentence_:

> David went to the meeting with Ashok by car.

_Write the thematic role frame given by the sentence above_.

Thematic Role:

- Verb: went
- Agent: David
- Co-agent: Ashok
- Destination: meeting
- Conveyance: car

### Resolving Ambiguity In Verbs Quiz

_Use the thematic role frames below (provided) to identify the meaning of "take" in the sentence_:

1. _I took an aspirin for my headache_. D, to medicate
2. _I took my briefcase to work today_. B, to bring or transport
3. _I took the casino for \$5 million_. G, to cheat or swindle

### Final Quiz

_What did you learn in this lesson_?

- Understanding is a very general all-purpose cognitive task that has a goal of making sense of the world
- The world constantly bombards us with many different types of data but we could make sense of the world by using constraints, structured knowledge representations, and lower-level bottom-up processing
- Lower-level bottom-up processing helps us activate knowledge structures from memory which then in turn helps us generate expectations (a top-down processing task)
