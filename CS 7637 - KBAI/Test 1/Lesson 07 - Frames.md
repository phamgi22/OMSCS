# Lesson 7

In this lesson we look into _frames_ the first step to building common sense reasoning. We will also cover the following:

1. Function of frames
2. Properties of frames
3. Relationship between frames and previous topics
4. Frames for advanced sense-making

## How Do We Make Sense Of A Sentence

A **frame** is a knowledge structure where a number of things could be happening in a particular knowledge representation. By breaking down a sentence into a frame, we could make more sense out of a sentence.

## Complex Frame Systems

Complex frame systems can be created by adding frames to an already existing frame, e.g., nouns in a sentence.

## Properties Of Frames

The following are properties of frames:

1. Represent stereotypes
2. Provide default values
3. Exhibit inheritance

## Frames And Semantic Nets

Frames and semantic networks are closely related. We can capture the same details as semantic networks in frames by denoting the same information within a frame representation.

## Frames And Production Systems

Referring back to production systems, we can think of frames as conceptual knowledge stored in the semantic memory. Since a frame tells us what to look for, processing is not just bottom up coming from things such as natural language processing but also partially top down as the mind is able to provide a frame of which knowledge could be structured.

## Section Quizzes

1. _Is the frog dead or alive_? Dead
2. _Where is the frog_? In Ashok's stomach
3. _Is Ashok happy or sad_? Happy

### Making Sense Of A Sentence Quiz

_Break down the following sentence into a frame: Angela ate lasagna with her dad last night at Olive Garden_.

- Subject: Angela
- Object: Lasagna
- Location: Olive Garden
- Time: Last night
- Utensils: None
- Object-alive: False
- Object-is: In-subject
- Subject-mood: Happy

### Interpreting A Frame System Quiz

_What sentence is expressed by these frames (provided)_?

Haruto ate a pepperoni pizza at Pizza Hut at noon.

### Frames And Semantic Networks Quiz

_Fill out the frame for the given picture (provided)_

| Name   | x        | y      | z      |
| ------ | -------- | ------ | ------ |
| Shape  | triangle | circle | circle |
| Size   | large    | large  | small  |
| Fill   | false    | false  | true   |
| Inside | N/A      | N/A    | y      |
| Above  | N/A      | x      | x      |

### Frames And Complex Understanding Quiz

_Write a frame representation of the story below_.

> Today, an extremely serious earthquake of magnitude 8.5 hit Lower Slabovia, killing 25 people and causing \$500 million in damage. The President of Lower Slabovia said that the hard-hit area near the Sadie Hawkins fault has been a danger zone for years.

- Subject: Earthquake
  - Time: Today
  - Magnitude: 8.5
  - Location: Lower Slabovia
  - People dead: 25
  - Cost of damage: \$500M

### Final Quiz

_What did you learn in this lesson_?

- Frames are a structured knowledge representation, production systems are analogous to atoms of knowledge representation and frames are more like molecules
- A production rule may only capture a small amount of information where a frame can capture a larger amount in an organized manner
- Frames enable us to construct a theory of cognitive processing which is not entirely bottom up but also partially top down as well (e.g., we do not just process data but also construct a knowledge representation in order to help us understand the world)
- We have stereotypes because they are cognitively efficient and enable us to have _default_ understanding of a concept that is already learned
